This directory is for shared files related to the Apache Ant build system.

Most notably, basic.xml is a complete build configuration for a simple Java project. While this could be copied and modified to produce a build.xml for a new project, a better way is to make the project's build.xml <import> basic.xml, and then apply any needed customizations on top of it. If you're creating a new project, copy build.xml.example to <project>/build.xml to get started.

The basic.xml build supports unit testing through the 'test' target. Test should typically be placed in a directory (typically 'test') parallel to the main Java source-code directory and the tests implemented in a parallel package hierarchy. By default, all classes in this directory ending in 'Test' will be compiled and run as JUnit test cases. To specify an individual test case or test suit to run, you should supply set the property 'testcase'. For example 'ant test -Dtestcase=org.idch.example.MySpecialTests'. HTML formatted reports will be generated and (by default) placed in 'build/tests/reports'.    

ivysettings.xml contains the configuration for using Apache Ivy to retrieve Java dependencies from the Ivy repository identified in ../ivy-repository.properties. This repository should be used rather than the public Maven 2 repositories, as the latter are missing some modules, and have others in weird places, or with incorrect metadata. If you don't yet have an ivy-repository.properties, copy ivy-repository.properties.example and modify as appropriate.
